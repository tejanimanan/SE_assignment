Q-4 What is MF Cod Rule of RDBMS Systems?

-->Dr Edgar F. Codd, after his extensive research on the Relational Model of database systems, came up with twelve 
rules of his own, which according to him, a database must obey in order to be regarded as a true relational database.
These rules can be applied on any database system that manages stored data using only its relational capabilities. 
This is a foundation rule, which acts as a base for all the other rules.

The twelve rules of Codd are as follows:
1. The information rule: All data is stored in tables, and each table has a unique name
2. The guaranteed access rule: Each table must have a primary key
3. Systematic treatment of null values: Each field in a table can have a null value,
4. Active online catalog: The database must have a catalog that is always available and up-to-date
5. Comprehensive data sublanguage: The database must have a language that can be used to access and
modify data
6. View updating: The database must allow views to be updated
7. High-level insert, update, and delete: The database must allow users to insert, update
and delete data at a high level
8. Physical data independence: The database must be independent of the physical storage of data
9. Logical data independence: The database must be independent of the logical structure of the data
10. Integrity independence: The database must be independent of the integrity constraints of the data
11. Distribution independence: The database must be independent of the distribution of the data
12. Non-subversion rule: The database must not allow any operation that could potentially violate the integrity
of the data.
