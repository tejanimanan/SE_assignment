Q-1 What do you understand By Database?

-->Databases are typically controlled by a database management system (DBMS), which acts as an interface between the database 
and its end users or programs. The DBMS allows users to store, retrieve, and edit data, and also provides core facilities to administer
 the database. Some examples of popular DBMSs include MySQL, Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL Server, FileMaker Pro, 
Oracle Database, and dBASE

-->A database is a collection of organized information that is stored electronically in a computer system. 
Databases can store any type of data, including words, numbers, images, videos, and files. 
They can be used to store and manage large amounts of structured and unstructured data, and they
can support a wide range of activities, including data storage, data analysis, and data management. 


-->Databases are common for use cases big and small, from massive websites to small businesses or small groups of people.
They make accessing information using a computer much easier, and once you understand what databases are, you might even 
want to build your own databases.
