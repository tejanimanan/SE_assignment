Q-5 What do you understand By Data Redundancy?
->      Data redundancy is a situation where data is stored in multiple locations, making it easier to recover in case  
of data loss or corruption.

->What are the benefits of data redundancy?

 
1.Improved data availability**: With data redundancy, you can access your data even if one or more storage devices fail.

2.Enhanced data security**: Redundant data can be used to detect and correct errors

3.Simplified data recovery**: In case of data loss or corruption, you can easily recover your data from the redundant copies.


###What are the types of data redundancy?

1.Data Duplication: This occurs when the same data is stored in multiple locations, such as when a customer's name and address are stored in both the sales and marketing databases.

2.Data Inconsistency: This occurs when different versions of the same data exist in different locations, such as when a customer's address is updated in one database but not in another.

3.Data Replication: This occurs when data is intentionally duplicated in multiple locations to improve data availability and performance, such as when data is replicated across multiple servers in a distributed database.

4.Data Redundancy in Data Storage: This occurs when data is stored in a way that is redundant or unnecessary, such as when a database stores both a person's age and their date of birth.

5.Data Redundancy in Data Transmission: This occurs when data is transmitted multiple times over a network, such as when a file is sent multiple times over the internet.
